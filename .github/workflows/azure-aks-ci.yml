# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Azure PowerShell Action
        uses: Azure/powershell@v1
        with:
          # Specify the Az PowerShell script here.
          inlineScript: |
            Write-Output "Test"
          # Azure PS version to be used to execute the script, example: 1.8.0, 2.8.0, 3.4.0. To use the latest version, specify "latest".
          azPSVersion: 4.7.0
          # Select the value of the ErrorActionPreference variable for executing the script. Options: stop, continue, silentlyContinue. Default is Stop.
          errorActionPreference: Stop # optional, default is Stop
          # If this is true, this task will fail if any errors are written to the error pipeline, or if any data is written to the Standard Error stream.
